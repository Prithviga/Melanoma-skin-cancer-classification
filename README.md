# Melanoma-skin-cancer-classification
-Here I took the dataset of benign and malignant for the classification of Melanoma skin disease
-Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread cancer cells throughout one's body through the blood or lymphatic system
-Benign refers to a condition, tumor, or growth that is not cancerous
